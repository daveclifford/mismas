A hodgepodge collection of various Unix scripts

## test-acl-bounderies.sh
Is a script that can be used on Linux, HPUX and Solaris to test how many ACLs can be defined on a test file or directory. It requires 1 parameter; an integer number that defines how many users/groups will be recreated and applied to that file. The `-c` removes all users and groups automatically.
